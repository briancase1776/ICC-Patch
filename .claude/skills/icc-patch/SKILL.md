# icc-patch

A patch is pipes that icc-pipes made, tees that icc-tee made and merges
that icc-merge made, plugged into a shape over N seats, and a map. A seat
is a number. Which Claude holds it is agreed outside this skill, like
whose desk a cable runs to. The parent, when it is in on it, is seat p.

    /tmp/icc-patch-XXXXXXXX/patch    SHAPE N LANES, then one line per end
    /tmp/icc-patch-XXXXXXXX/made     SCRIPTS DIR per pipe and fitting, in order

## Operations

    scripts/create SHAPE N [LANES]  make the pipes and fittings SHAPE needs
                                    over N seats, LANES lanes each (even,
                                    default 2), print the patch's directory
    scripts/list                    one line per patch: DIR up|down SHAPE N LANES
    scripts/remove DIR              remove the fittings, then the pipes,
                                    then DIR

create runs the create scripts in `$ICC_PIPES`, `$ICC_TEE` and
`$ICC_MERGE`, by default `../ICC-Pipes`, `../ICC-Tee` and `../ICC-Merge`
beside this repo. remove runs the remove scripts create used. If a piece
is missing, create makes nothing.

## Shapes

    star     seat i shares a pipe with seat p, i on side 0, p on side 1.
             Nothing joins the seats to each other
    ring     seat i shares a pipe with seat i+1, i on side 0, i+1 on
             side 1, around the end back to 0
    mesh     a merge and a tee in the middle. Every seat writes one end
             into the merge; the tee hands what comes out to every
             seat's read end, the writer's too. Where there is a tee:
             mesh 2 collapses to one pipe and has none
    ring-p   ring, and each hop is a tee: one outlet to the next seat,
             one to a merge that seat p reads. p writes one end, and a
             tee hands it to a read end of its own at every seat, so a
             seat holds three ends: its write end, a read end from the
             seat before it, and a read end from p
    mesh-p   mesh, with seat p on it like any other

N counts seats other than p. Fewer seats, fewer cables, by the shape
alone: a fitting with one end on a side is no fitting. mesh 2 is one
pipe, and so is mesh-p 1, one seat with its parent, and so is star 1.
ring 2 is mesh 2. ring 1 is one pipe with seat 0 on both ends. mesh 1 is
no pipe. ring-p 1 is seat 0's hop tee round to itself, and a pipe it
shares with p. Where a shape collapses to one pipe the two seats share
it, and each writes and reads there: the lower numbered seat holds side
0 and the other side 1, p counting as the higher, except on a ring-p 1,
where the end p holds is the one p writes, so p holds side 0. ring 1 has
no second seat: seat 0 holds both sides, and what it writes on one it
reads on the other. On the rest a seat's own words do not come back to
it, since there is no tee to hand them round.

## The map

After the first line, one line per end a seat holds:

    SEAT SIDE DIR PEERS

Seat SEAT holds side SIDE of the pipe at DIR. PEERS is the seats on the
other side, comma separated. Pipes says what a side writes and reads.

- A DIR on two seats' lines is a pipe those two share: what each writes
  there reaches the other and what it reads there came from the other,
  both ways. On a star every end is one of these, so p holds one end per
  seat and knows which seat it is talking to. ring 1 is the one shape
  where both lines are the same seat's: seat 0 holds both sides.
- A seat is in its own PEERS on a mesh of three or more, because the
  merge and the tee reach every seat, the writer included. Filtering
  PEERS for the others means taking your own number out.
- A DIR on one line only is through a fitting, and goes one way. A write
  end, side 0, sends to PEERS and reads nothing. A read end, side 1,
  receives from PEERS and sends nowhere. Tee's and Merge's SKILL.md say
  why. No pipe the map names has two writers on it, in any shape, so the
  line is the whole of it: two names, both ways; one name, one way. A
  merge's outlet has one writer per inlet, and the map names it nowhere.

    grep '^3 ' "$x/patch"                          every end seat 3 holds

    x=$(scripts/create mesh 4 6)
    e=$(awk '$1==0 && $2==0 {print $3}' "$x/patch")  # seat 0's write end
    .../icc-frames/scripts/write "$e" 0 < photo.jpg
    e=$(awk '$1==2 && $2==1 {print $3}' "$x/patch")  # seat 2's read end
    timeout 5 .../icc-frames/scripts/read "$e" 1 > photo.jpg

## Facts

- A patch is the sum of its parts. Every fact in Pipes' SKILL.md holds
  for every end, and every fact in Tee's and Merge's for every copy. The
  bay adds nothing to them.
- On a read end with more than one PEER, nothing says which one a byte
  came from, and two writing at once interleave, as Pipes, Tee and Merge
  say. Whose turn it is, is agreed above this skill.
- Where writes meet is the merge: the one in the middle of a mesh, the
  one seat p reads on a ring-p. Two seats writing at once interleave
  there, as Merge says, and nowhere else do two writers share a pipe. A
  star and a ring have no fittings and nothing to meet at.
- On a mesh the tee hands a writer its own words back, so a seat can see
  its own go past the merge: the tee puts each chunk on every outlet
  before it reads the next, as Tee says, so nothing written after them
  can come before them at any seat. On a ring-p nothing a seat writes
  comes back to that seat, and nothing p writes comes back to p, so
  there is no such moment — except on a ring-p 1, where the hop tee goes
  round to the one seat there is, and its own words do come back.
- Whose turn it is, and whatever the seats leave in DIR to agree it, is
  theirs; remove takes DIR whole.
- Through fittings, a seat that never reads stalls every writer once its
  end fills. Read every end, or keep the payload inside one. How much
  that is, is how many pipes lie between a write end and a read end,
  which only the bay knows: a star or a ring one, a ring-p hop two, a
  mesh of three or more three, and a shape that collapsed to one pipe
  one. What one pipe holds is Pipes' fact, and Tee's and Merge's
  SKILL.md say what a fitting adds. It is not one number: measured on a
  mesh, 208K, 224K and 256K each went both ways on different runs.
- A seat may sit in more than one patch. A ring and a mesh over the same
  seats is two patches.
- list says up when every pipe and fitting says up. If one is down, the
  patch is down; remove it and create it again.
- Nothing holds a patch open. Its pipes and fittings do their own
  holding. Remove one of them by hand and list says down.
- The scripts are bash, not sh. Run one by its path and let its first
  line pick the interpreter; `sh scripts/create` overrides it, and what
  it does then is not promised.

## In Claude Code

Every Bash call is a fresh shell. The pipes and fittings are their own
processes, as their skills say, so a patch outlives calls. Seats in one
session share the container and its /tmp; sessions do not, so no patch
crosses that line.
